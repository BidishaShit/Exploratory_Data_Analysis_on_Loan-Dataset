# Exploratory_Data_Analysis_on_Loan-Dataset
Steps of the EDA The EDA project will need to include the following steps, presented in this sequence: 
1. Display descriptive statistics on the dataset.
2. Check if any records in the data have any missing values; handle the missing data as appropriate.
3. Build a graph visualizing the distribution of one or more individual continuous variables of the dataset
4. Build a graph visualizing the relationship in a pair of continuous variables. Determine the correlation between them.
5. Display unique values of a categorical variable.
6. Build a contingency table of two potentially related categorical variables. Conduct a statistical test of the independence between them.
7. Retrieve one or more subset of rows based on two or more criteria and present descriptive statistics on the subset(s).
8. Conduct a statistical test of the significance of the difference between the means of two subsets of the data.
9. Create one or more tables that group the data by a certain categorical variable and displays summarized information for each group (e.g. the mean or sum within the group).
10. Implement a linear regression model and interpret its output
